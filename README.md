# QNETGAN version 9419
### Yes this is the 9419th version of QNETGAN
Don't ask why there are so many versions.

## Navigating this Repository
Lucky you! There's only one folder. It's called `raw`. It contains the QM9 Dataset, downloaded from [here](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/datasets.html#torch_geometric.datasets.QM9). There are also various files.
1. `cdiscriminator.py`: contains code for the classical Discriminator
2. `datahelper.py`: contains code for utilities that help with loading and processing the QM9 dataset
3. `qgenerator.py`: contains code for the quantum Generator
4. `trainer.py`: contains code for training the QNETGAN **I HAVEN'T REVIEWED THE CODE YET**
5. `utils.py`: contains various utilities for other stuff

## Making Changes to Files
Here are a few rules
> Make sure to document code changes. For example: *fixed an issue with code failing for CH4*
> If your name isn't Max or Adelina then **create a pull request everytime you make a change**.
> Don't mess around with the code. But you can change variable names to things like `sussy`, `imposter`, `amongus`, etc, **as long as they are for temporary variables ONLY!**
